I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders and TL1 pre-doctoral fellow in the Institute for Clinical Research Education at the University of Pittsburgh. Before returning to school in Pittsburgh, I worked as a clinical speech-language pathologist in Charlotte, NC in outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation settings. 

Outside of my day job, you can find me with my wife, Amanda - somewhere outdoors, typically in a national park, and ideally on top of a mountain.
