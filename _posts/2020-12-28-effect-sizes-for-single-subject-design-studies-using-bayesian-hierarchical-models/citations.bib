	abstract = {Background: Advances in statistical methods and computing power have led to a renewed interest in addressing the statistical analysis challenges posed by Small-N Designs (SND). Linear mixed-effects modeling (LMEM) is a multiple regression technique that is flexible and suitable for SND and can provide standardized effect sizes and measures of statistical significance.Aims: Our primary goals are to: 1) explain LMEM at the conceptual level, situating it in the context of treatment studies, and 2) provide practical guidance for implementing LMEM in repeated measures SND.Methods \& procedures: We illustrate an LMEM analysis, presenting data from a longitudinal training study of five individuals with acquired dysgraphia, analyzing both binomial (accuracy) and continuous (reaction time) repeated measurements.Outcomes \& results: The LMEM analysis reveals that both spelling accuracy and reaction time improved and, for accuracy, improved significantly more quickly under a training schedule with distributed,...},

	issn = {20734859},
	doi = {10.32614/rj-2018-017},
	abstract = {The brms package allows R users to easily specify a wide range of Bayesian single-level and multilevel models which are fit with the probabilistic programming language Stan behind the scenes. Several response distributions are supported, of which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and shape) can be predicted. Non-linear relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms or semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. Multivariate models can be fit as well. To make all of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula syntax of lme4. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing relevant aspects of the syntax.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Bayesian multilevel models are increasingly used to overcome the limitations of frequentist approaches in the analysis of complex structured data. This tutorial introduces Bayesian multilevel modeling for the specific analysis of speech data, using the brms package developed in R. Method: In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to Bayesian multilevel modeling by reanalyzing a phonetic data set containing formant (F1 and F2) values for 5 vowels of standard Indonesian (ISO 639-3:ind), as spoken by 8 speakers (4 females and 4 males), with several repetitions of each vowel. Results: We first give an introductory overview of the Bayesian framework and multilevel modeling. We then show how Bayesian multilevel models can be fitted using the probabilistic programming language Stan and the R package brms, which provides an intuitive formula syntax. Conclusions: Through this tutorial, we demonstrate some of the advantages of the Bayesian framework for statistical modeling and provide a detailed case study, with complete source code for full reproducibility of the analyses (https://osf.io/dpzcb/).},

NAP is a novel application of an established effect size known in various forms as Area Under the Curve (AUC), the Common Language Effect Size (CL), the Probability of Superiority (PS), the Dominance Statistic (DS), Mann-Whitney's U, and Sommers D, among others. NAP was compared with 3 other non-overlap-based indices: PND (percent of nonoverlapping data), PEM (percent of data points exceeding the median), and PAND (percent of all nonoverlapping data), as well as Pearson's R(2). Five questions were addressed about NAP: (a) typical NAP values, (b) its ability to discriminate among typical single-case research results, (c) its power and precision (confidence interval width), (d) its correlation with the established effect size index, R(2), and (e) its relationship with visual judgments. Results were positive, the new index equaling or outperforming the other overlap indices on most criteria.},

	abstract = {A new index for analysis of single-case research data was proposed, Tau-U, which combines nonoverlap between phases with trend from within the intervention phase. In addition, it provides the option of controlling undesirable Phase A trend. The derivation of Tau-U from Kendall's Rank Correlation and the Mann-Whitney U test between groups is demonstrated. The equivalence of trend and nonoverlap is also shown, with supportive citations from field leaders. Tau-U calculations are demonstrated for simple AB and ABA designs. Tau-U is then field tested on a sample of 382 published data series. Controlling undesirable Phase A trend caused only a modest change from nonoverlap. The inclusion of Phase B trend yielded more modest results than simple nonoverlap. The Tau-U score distribution did not show the artificial ceiling shown by all other nonoverlap techniques. It performed reasonably well with autocorrelated data. Tau-U shows promise for single-case applications, but further study is desirable. Copyright © 2011. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In the field of aphasia, a large number of single-subject research studies have been conducted, providing clinical outcome data that are potentially useful for clinicians and researchers; however, it has been difficult to discern the relative potency of these treatments in a standardized manner. In this paper we describe an approach to quantify treatment outcomes for single-subject research studies using effect sizes. These values provide a means to compare treatment outcomes within and between individuals, as well as to compare the relative strength of various treatments. Effect sizes also can be aggregated in order to conduct meta-analyses of specific treatment approaches. Consideration is given to optimizing research designs and providing adequate data so that the value of treatment research is maximized.},

To do this, we amalgamated the assessment and therapy results from 33 people with aphasia following cerebral vascular accident (CVA), all of whom had received the same anomia therapy (based on progressive phonemic and orthographic cueing). Previous studies with smaller numbers of participants had found a possible relationship between anomia therapy performance and some language and cognitive assessments. Because this study had access to a larger data set than previous studies, we were able to replicate the previous findings and also to verify two overarching factors which were predictive of therapy gain: a cognitive factor and a phonological factor. The status of these two domains was able to predict both immediate and longer-term therapy gain. Pre-treatment naming ability also predicted gain after the anomia therapy. When combined, both cognitive and language (naming or phonological) skills were found to be independent predictors of therapy outcome.},
